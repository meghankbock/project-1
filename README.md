Project 1 - Interactive Front-End Project

**Overview:** Taste of the Day gives you an easy variety of choices for what type of meal, cuisine, and drink you would like. Once youâ€™ve made your selection, we not only give you the recipes and ingredients, but also let you schedule it on our week long calendar.

**Motivation:** Our motivation here at Taste of the Day is to keep people happy and full.

**User Story:** As a busy person always on the go, I often had to settle for whatever I could find in the fridge just to make it through the week. I needed a change. I wanted a fast and easy way to not only be able to search, but also plan out new and exciting meals.
